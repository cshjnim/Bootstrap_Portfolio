# Bootstrap_Portfolio


1. Inside `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate the portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout - rows & colomns

     * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens,  should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on the mobile device versus the computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on  portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. the Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy the new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
